            Whenever you update TallStackUI, check whether there have been changes to the <x-block>config/tallstackui.php</x-block>
            file. As this file can be published for your application, if a new component is added in a new version of TallStackUI, this
            file needs to be updated with the addition of the new component.

            If you are using TallStackUI <u>on a version lower than Laravel 10.35</u> you will face
            an issue related to component attributes. <b>This happens due to a bug in Laravel
            below version 10.35</b> that means that when passing attributes to a component that contains child
            components, such as input, buttons, badge, and others, they are not applied:
        </p>
        <x-code language="blade" :contents="$laravel1035Bug" disable-copy />
        <p class="underline decoration-red-500 decoration-4 underline-offset-4">
            To fix this issue, ensure your Laravel is updated to a version higher than 10.35.
